When creating my web portfolio, I started by designing my wireframes with the Bootstrap grid system in mind. I then followed a mobile-first approach as I applied semantic HTML and styled my page using Bootstrap classes, adding custom CSS when necessary. Afterward, I made my site responsive using the Bootstrap grid system and added final details such as accessibility features, image optimization and the Hover.css library. I faced several challenges throughout the development process, particularly when I was unsure if certain elements could be achieved with Bootstrap alone. For instance, adding a background image required custom CSS, which I discovered after extensive online research. This experience taught me the value of falling back on custom CSS when needed. Overall, I learned the importance of the design process, especially wireframing, which made development much smoother. Additionally, I realized how important organization is when handling a website with multiple pages, as a well-structured file system and neatly arranged code are essential for efficient development.
